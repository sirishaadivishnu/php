# Programming Language: PHP

This repository contains some of PHP programs that I wrote during my traineeship as a full stack developer. These programs cover a wide range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, functions and web development.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you'll need to have PHP installed on your system or set up Visual Studio to debug PHP programs. You may also refer the PHP manual to get started:

```
https://www.php.net/manual/en/
```

Once you have setup PHP, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/sirishaadivishnu/php.git
```

## Directory Structure

The repository does contain a directory to host a program which requires support functions to be called via global variables. At the end of this Readme.md I have created a table to describe each program in the repository.

## Contributing

If you find any bugs or issues in the programs, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
